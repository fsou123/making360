\problem

{\large If the camera captures full 360 where do the director and crew go? \par}

One of the challenges with VR is that it captures everything in the scene including the equipment, lighting and crew. You can hide some of the technology by dressing the set and camouflaging. Or you could write it into the story. The director could be an extra!



\solution

{\large Scope out a hiding spot. \par}

Before shooting, plan your exit route and find a safe space completely hidden from the view of the camera. Make sure to hide your shadow self as well. 
With lighting, you can hide some of your lights in blind spots. Use a \textbf{\nameref{chap:11}} or do a quickstitch test to check if the equipment is not in the shot.
