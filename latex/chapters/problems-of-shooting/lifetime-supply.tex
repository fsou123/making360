\problem

{\large You want to shoot a glorious long take or beautiful time lapse but the batteries might die halfway through. \par}

With WiFi on, GoPro battery life lasts around 1:05-1:30 hours for the HERO4 Black depending on which settings you are on. If you are using the WiFi remote, then the battery will last 0:55-1:40 hours. Shooting a long take is not recommended for the faint of heart! The cameras may dip out from battery life, overheating or firmware issues. If you are up for the thrills, plan to at least be connected to a source. 


\solution

{\large Connect to an external battery source through a mini USB cable. \par}

If you are in an indoor situation then you can plug into the wall. If you are trekking through the wild west then bring an external power pack and lots of water. We recommend Anton Bauer battery packs.


\tip The mini USB connector is extremely delicate so using a right angled cable might be gentler on the port. However, right angled cables have the tendency to break easily during travel but will be more convenient to replace than soldering back together the pieces of the camera connector.
