\problem

{\large The cameras are overheating! \par}

When recording in high performance mode, the cameras start heating up, using up more power and possibly shutting down. 


\solution

{\large Keep it cool. Chill between long takes. \par}

The HERO4 Black features unique high-performance video modes: 

4K30/24 4K24 SuperView
\\
2.7K48/50 2.7K30 SuperView, 2.7K 4:3 
\\
1440p80 
\\
1080p120/90 
\\
960p120 
\\
720p120

The cameras naturally consume more power to run these modes and will increase in temperature. When shooting 360 video, you will most likely be using one of these modes so give the cameras a break and have backup cameras if you can. The 360 rigs pack multiple cameras into a tight formation and the cameras generate even more heat next to each other.

When the camera overheats you will get an indicator that it is shutting down.

Give the camera some time to cool down and let it rest. It is not recommended to shoot on high performance mode for an extended period of time and duration. For long takes you will risk both overheating and power drainage. Again, have the cameras plugged into a \textbf{\nameref{chap:08}} external source if attempting super long takes. 

\tip Add a tiny heatsink in the area between the lens and the power button. Heat can be a serious issue, especially if you are recording using the 4K video mode.
